\section{Introduction}
%A health information system (HIS) is the socio-technical subsystem of a care delivery organization~\citep{bb}.
%This includes its different application systems, computers, and network components as well as their users.
Medical informatics students, who are trained for executive positions in information management (IM) departments of healthcare institutions, such as hospitals, need a clear terminology of their domain.
This terminology is offered by SNIK~\citep{semantischesnetz,sniktec}, the Semantic Network of Information Management in Hospitals (\enquote{Krankenhaus} in German), which integrates knowledge extracted from three textbooks~\citep{bb,ob,he} and other sources such as interviews in the form of Linked Open Data.
SNIK describes health information management (HIM) functions, roles executing these functions, and entity types, the information used or updated by these functions, see \cref{fig:metamodel}.
%Because the textbooks describe those concepts in the abstract sense, and not those of any concrete hospital, those entities are modelled as classes and individuals at the same time, using OWL 2 DL punning.
%Thus, \emph{function}, \emph{role} and \emph{entity type} are metaclasses and the ontology of SNIK is a meta model as depicted in \cref{fig:metamodel}.
SNIK version \snikversionlink{} contains \sniktriples{} triples describing \snikproperties{} properties and \snikclasses{} classes, of which there are \snikroles{} roles, \snikfunctions{} functions and \snikentitytypes{} entity types.
%Applications include a graph visualization for exploratiory learning, 
%

\end{figure}
This paper presents SNIK Quiz, an open source\footnotemark{} browser game, see \cref{fig:snikquiz}, in which students answer multiple-choice questions about HIM, including an evaluation by domain experts and a student.
\footnotetext{Source code available under the MIT license at \url{https://github.com/snikproject/quiz}. The user interface is a fork of \url{https://github.com/davidrayoussef/react-quiz}.}
%A HIS processes data, information, and knowledge and its management involves planning, monitoring and directing those activities.
%Due to the complexity and the unique conditions in health care, HIS management is an challenging task.
%There are many different frameworks, textbooks and articles describing the scope of HIS management from the perspective of medical informatics.
%However, the disciplines of business informatics and information systems (IS) provide an even broader view on information systems and their management.
%A structured representation of the different perspectives leads to a holistic view on HIS management and helps help researchers and students connect their existing knowledge with further knowledge from other sources during research and learning.
%three textbooks~\citep{bb,ob,he} and other sources, see \cref{tab:source}.
%\section{Sources}\label{sec:sources}
%Three textbooks provide different views on the domain of Hospital Information Management:
%\citet{bb} presents a broad view on \enquote{typical architectures of health information systems and their systematic strategic management}.
%\citep{ob} concentrates on the \emph{tactical} management of information systems in general and on healthcare in particular.
%The focus of tactical management lies on the planning and operation of projects.
%\citet{he} explains information management beyond the scope of healthcare.
%Other sources are interviews and standards.
%CIOX is based on an interview with the CIO of the Universitätsklinikum Leipzig.
%IT4IT is based on the IT4IT standard.\todo{Sebastian: Was über Standards und IT4IT schreiben}
%
%We discuss advantages and disadvantages of the interfaces and give recommendations on which ones present the best compromise for different use cases and target audiences.
%We conclude with plans for future work on interlinking and visualization.
%As the domain is large and highly relevant to students of Medical Informatics, modelling the knowledge is not only possible but also very useful.
%Due to different frameworks and textbooks dealing with information management in healthcare, modelling the knowledge unravels the links between the different views on information management.
%These are only implicitly known or not known at all by experts in the field.
%
%
%Publishing textbook knowledge as Linked Data enables different ways of teaching.
%The data is continously revised: users constantly report wrong or missing data in the visualization, which is then corrected, respectively revised, by the researchers of the project.

\end{figure*}
SNIK Quiz is designed as single-player game for English speaking students of Medical Informatics.
This group is diverse and includes students of Medicine, who may not have a background in Computer Science and Semantic Web technologies.
Target devices are PCs, tablets and smartphones, so multiple operating systems and input methods need to be supported.
Thus, SNIK Quiz is designed as an multiple choice quiz with at most four possible answers and published as an open source web application.

\vspace{-3pt}

%In order to specify, which information should be extracted from the books and to facilitate comparisons, we use a common data model.
%Because processed textbooks contain abstract knowledge instead of information about any specific hospital, all concepts are modelled as classes.
%We thus call our data model the \enquote{meta model} in accordance with the term's definition as a shared modelling language~\citep[p.~8]{ob}.
%The meta model (see \cref{fig:metamodel}) provides a common vocabulary for the domain of HIS management and thus defines, which superclasses and properties can be used.
%SNIK version \snikversionlink{} comprises five subontologies that are built upon the meta model, see Table 1.
%At the head of the class hierarchy (see \cref{fig:hierarchy}) is the \enquote{Top} class, which has exactly three disjunctive subclasses.
%At the head of the class hierarchy is the \enquote{Top} class, which has exactly three disjunctive subclasses.
%
%Following the meta model, each class has to be a subclass of exactly one of them.
%The correct superclass of a new concept can be found by answering the question: Who (\enquote{Role}) does what (\enquote{Function}) and which information (\enquote{EntityType}) is needed? If a concept is neither of them, it cannot be modeled using the meta model.
%As the subclass relation is transitive, a new class can be placed further down the hierarchy and it can still be inferred, whether it is a Function, Role or EntityType (see Figure 3).
%Besides the subclass relationship, two classes can be connected with relations provided by the meta model.
%The generic \enquote{is associated with} relationship carries little information.
%For example, a role and a function can be connected as \enquote{is involved in} \enquote{is responsible for} and \enquote{approves}.
%Relations that are neither of them can either be modeled by using the generic \enquote{is associated with} relation or by creating and using a new sub relation of \enquote{is associated with}
%
%As a concession to practicality, we express each geleral rule extracted from a textbook as a single triple using classes as subject and object, and a property of the meta model.
%For example, the rule "the CEO is involved in project reviews" is modelled as \enquote{\texttt{:Ceo} \aurl{meta}{isInvolvedIn} \texttt{:ProjectReview}.}, where \texttt{:Ceo} is a subclass of \aurl{meta}{Role} and \aurl{meta}{ProjectReview} is a subclass of \aurl{meta}{Function}.
%While an OWL restrictions using \aurl{owl}{someValuesFrom} and \aurl{owl}{allValuesFrom} would be technically correct, the knowledge is not expressed that specifically in the textbooks.
%Additionally, encoding each fact as a single triple facilitates tool support and prevents inconsistencies through non-atomic changes.

%\section{Data Model}\label{sec:architecture}
%The initial structure of the meta model is defined in \citet{domaene}.
%The \enquote{meta model} defines three basic disjunctive classes and their possible relations: Roles (who), Function (does what) and Entity Types (and which information is therefore needed).
%A set of modular subontologies define subclasses of those three classes and their relations as described by a certain knowledge source about information management in hospitals:
%The \textbf{Semantic Network of Information Management in Hospitals} (SNIK\footnote{Hospital means \enquote{Krankenhaus} in German.}) is a modular OWL 2 DL ontology.
%from different sources:% three textbooks, an interview and a standard.

%\section{Data Transformation Process}
%\subsection{Interlinking}
%As shown in \cref{...}, we aligned our dataset to several others:
%We manually aligned our dataset to HITO, the Health IT Ontology~\citep{hitometh2}
%We automatically aligned our dataset to:
%- DBpedia~\citep{dbpedia}, as  
%- 
%\section{Lifecycle}\label{sec:application}
%Virtuoso SPARQL endpoint is used for querying and as data source for all our applications  

%After the initial extraction step, SNIK is published and users suggest problems or enhancements.%Besides issues of collaborative editing, this required a regular export and reupload, which delayed the effect of changes in SNIK to the user facing applications.
%- git repository (link): collaborative editing but protege can cause large diffs -> people who understand rdf enough to use text editor ttl/rdfxml 
%- use ontowiki: slow but user friendly, undo function,
%- SPARUL queries
%The technical environment of those services is described in~\citet{sniktec}.

\end{table}

To provide difficult wrong answers, the so called \emph{distractors}, we use direct neighbours of the classes that represent the correct answers.
Due to the limited nesting capabilties of SPARQL, which does not support loops but only subqueries that cannot access variables declared outside their scope, querying for distinct sets of 4 neighbours, where exactly one was connected over a certain property to a certain object, was not possible with our Virtuoso SPARQL endpoint initially.
We circumvented the timeout by calculating the neighbour-relation as a first step and uploading it to the endpoint.
%
%SNIK Quiz is freely available as an open source web application.
Because SNIK only contains the knowledge that the source textbooks describe, it does not contain the complete domain of Hospital Information Management.
As such, negative questions are problematic, as the given relationship could hold in the real world but not be described in the textbook source of the class.
The same problem concerns the distractors of positive questions.
So this problem cannot be avoided.
However, this is one of the reasons that we do not ask count questions like \enquote{How many functions is the CIO responsible for?}, which do not help much for learning anyways. % improve writing
Relationships could also hold implicitly through the subclass hierarchy.
For example, \aurl{bb}{ChiefInformationOfficer} is a subclass of \aurl{bb}{InformationManagementStaff}, which is responsible for \aurl{bb}{OperationalInformationManagement}.
It is unclear, whether the CIO is also responsible for operational information management.



\subsection{Question Types}
\iffalse
TODO: Add the old question types, but only the b-versions (so no suffix is required in this paper)

\paragraph{label-definition}
This gives the user a definition and asks for  the correct term. The terms to be considered are chosen from terms, which are positioned within a distance of two vertices in the graph. So, relative semantic similarity can be assumed. This makes the label-definition-approach especially worthwhile when basic knowledge of terms of information management is required.
 
% set this as second strat to gain constistency to table 5 
\paragraph{definition}
The definition approach focuses on the question of which definition is fitting for a given term. 
To increase the difficulty of the strategy, the distractors are chosen to be at most two vertices away from the edge which represents the correct term, much like in the label-definition-type.

Intertwined focuses on the connectivity of the knowledge graph.
In each answer, three related concepts are given.
The correct answer is the one where all concepts are directly connected with each other, that is, they form a triangle in the graph, see \cref{fig:intertwined}.
The distractors should then not form this triangle but a different shape based on the difficulty.
In the difficult variation of the distractor, one of the three concept pairs is directly connected, one has a shortest path of length 2 and the third one has neither.
In this easier variation, two concepts pairs are connected with a shortest path of length 2 instead.

This question type tests the connection between a textbook about tactical information management~\cite{ob} and one about strategic information management~\cite{bb} based on the existing \aurl{skos}{closeMatch} interlinks.
The aim is to help students transfer knowledge about one textbook to the other.
The questions have the form: \emph{\enquote{In [Tactical / Strategic IM], the [subject] [predicate] the [object], while in [Strategic / Tactical IM], the [subject] [predicate] the [object].}} with two possible answers: true and false.
Examplarly questions are given in \cref{tab:closematch}.

%Dies beinhaltet dann Begriffe, welche in beiden Büchern auftreten. Ausgehend davon sollen dann ebenfalls in beiden Büchern auftretende Begriffe gesucht werden, welche verschiedene Grundklassen aufweisen: im einen Buch als Aufgabe und im anderen als Subjekt. Damit sollen dann Sätze gebildet werden, welche eine Gegenüberstellung in den Büchern erlauben, um so Brücken zu bauen und das Wissen des einen Buches effektiv auf das andere transferieren zu können.

The \emph{occurence} question type is a specialization of \emph{closeMatch}, where the student has to choose whether a term occurs in~\cite{ob},~\cite{bb}, in both textbooks or neither of them.
Exemplary questions are given in \cref{tab:occurence}.

\section{Results}\label{sec:application}
The question types definition-a and contains-a were used to generate 1231 English questions, see \cref{tab:templates}.
It was used by students from the Universities of Amsterdam, Heidelberg and Leipzig during the international Frank van Swieten lectures in 2019.

\section{Discussion}
Clover Quiz~\citep{cloverquiz} shows that Linked Data knowledge bases can be used to semi-automatically generate cross-domain multiple-choice questions using DBpedia~\citep{dbpedia}.

\label{tab:templates} subclasses and superclasses
because of OWL punning entities are individuals but also classes and can have superclasses and subclasses
subclasses of the correct answer are semantically correct because subclasses are subsets
superclasses on the other hand are only partially correct because the relation only holds for the subclass
example who is responsible for medical admission: Health Care Professional - Physician - Senior Physician
however SPARQL endpoint doesnt do inferencing so it will not mark that as correct
we could add the transitive hull for such triples but we think it is good like this, it increases the difficulty and you need to choose the most general correct answer


%We showed that knowledge on the management of information systems in medicine and health care is made publicly available using open standards over several interfaces with different compromises between expressivity and accessibility.
%It can be combined with other knowledge in biomedical and health informatics and in other disciplines.
